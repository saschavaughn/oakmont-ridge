                        <p>Marty...the future isn't written. It can be changed; you know that! Anyone can make their future whatever they want it to be. I can't let this one little photograph determine my entire destiny. I have to live my life according to what I believe is right... in my heart. (sighs) Doc...you're a scientist. So you tell me. What's the right thing to do, up here?? (he points to his head.) (thinks and then sighs) You're right, Marty. (They pull a switch and the Delorean rolls slowly down the tracks.) Wow, that worked great.</p>

                <p>(to Clara) You're doing fine! Nice and steady! Come on! Just a little further! (All the while Clara is moving closer to him, climbing on the edge of the train.) I can't Emmett, I'm scared! (into walkie-talkie) SEVENTY! Come on...you're doing fine...nice and easy...that's it...don't look down... (into walkie-talkie) DOC! THE RED LOG'S ABOUT TO BLOW!!!</p>
                <p>(Outside) (The DeLorean lands outside Hilldale - on the No Landing sign! - and Doc gets out.) All right Einie, let's find Jennifer! I don't believe it, I live in Hilldale! This is great! Way to go McFly! Marty, stay here, change clothes, I need you on holler.I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. (writes the number on the back of the Clock Tower flyer.) Bye. (Marty's House) Perfect, just perfect. (Marty arrives in time to see a Tow Truck driving up with what's left of his Dad's Car. Inside Biff Tannen is griping at George McFly, Marty's father. George is a skinny man, and very nerdy.) I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed.</p>
                <p>(Hallway) (o.s) And he wouldn't have spent all those years feeling sorry for himself. (Marty Jr. has just come home. He walks past Jennifer.) Marty Jr.Hey Mom, nice pants. (o.s) I think the real reason your mother married him was because she felt sorry for him.</p>
